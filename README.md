Blog and Website

This is a simple static page for updating my current skills, projects, and anything I am interested in. I decided to do the formatting manually as opposed to using a CMS or framework to keep things simple... It can be easy to get lost down a rabit hole of a complexity when I really do not have the time :P

Enjoy!
